### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the Github Account of mettbroetchen43.  
  
"mettbroetchen43" made first experiences on programming back in the 1990s using QuickBASIC and QB4.5 on Microsoft DOS 6.2 Platform.  
Nowadays, he's mostly using Python, but also plans to reimplement his old QB Projects on QB64.  
Beside Programming, his hobbies are gaming and using the computer in general.

stream development activities on Twitch.
